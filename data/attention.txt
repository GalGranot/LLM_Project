The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder.
The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism.
We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.
Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.
Our model achieves x on the English to German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over y.
On the English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art score of z after training for days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.
